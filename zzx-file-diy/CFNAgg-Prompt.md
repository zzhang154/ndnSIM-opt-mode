# CFNAgg Distributed Data Aggregation System (ndnSIM 2.9)

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Implement a hierarchical, segment-level data aggregation system in a Named Data Networking (NDN) simulation using ndnSIM 2.9. The system, referred to as **CFNAgg**, will aggregate data in-network across a tree of nodes, combining values as they travel from producer nodes up through aggregator nodes to a root node (consumer). The data model is continuous and time-slotted: producer nodes generate a new value at each time slot (with an increasing sequence number), and these values are aggregated at intermediate nodes on the way to the root.

*Ultimately, this specification will guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate modular, multi-file C++ code implementing the CFNAgg system in ndnSIM 2.9.*

### Node Roles

- **Producer Nodes**: (Leaf nodes that generate original data values every time slot.)  
  - Each producer produces a new data value for every time slot (identified by a sequence number, e.g., a slot index).  
  - On receiving an Interest for sequence **N**, a producer returns a Data packet containing its value for slot **N** (assume the value is readily available without delay).  
  - Producer nodes can satisfy Interests for sequence numbers in any order (they do not need to receive requests in strict sequence).

- **Aggregator Nodes**: (Intermediate nodes that collect data from one or more children and forward an aggregated result upward.)  
  - Act in a dual role: each aggregator is a **consumer** to its children (requesting and receiving data) and a **producer** to its parent (sending aggregated data upward).  
  - Maintain state to aggregate child responses for each sequence. Upon receiving an Interest for sequence **N** from its parent, an aggregator forwards Interests for **N** to all its children (unless children are configured to push data for each slot).  
  - As children respond with Data for **N**, store these values in an **aggregation buffer** (see below) associated with that sequence.  
  - Once all expected child Data for **N** have arrived, compute the aggregated result (e.g., sum of the values) and send a single Data packet for **N** upward to its own parent.  
  - If some child data is missing or delayed, handle it via NACKs or straggler timers (as detailed later). Each sequence is handled independently, so an aggregator can manage multiple sequences concurrently (processing time slots out of order if necessary).

- **Root Node (Consumer)**: (The top-level consumer that initiates data collection and receives final aggregated results.)  
  - The root initiates the process by sending Interests for new sequence numbers (time slots) in order. It can pipeline multiple Interests in flight for efficiency, but issues them in increasing sequence order.  
  - It receives the final **aggregated Data** for each sequence from its direct children (or directly from producers if the tree has only one level). Each sequence number should result in exactly one Data packet arriving at the root, representing the aggregation of all producers’ values for that slot.  
  - Lower-level nodes (aggregators and producers) handle each sequence independently and do not require globally ordered Interests. Only the root enforces sending Interests for new sequences sequentially (to maintain a controlled progression of the simulation).

## System Design Requirements

### Aggregation Mechanics

The system performs **packet-level in-network aggregation** at each aggregator. For a given time slot (identified by a sequence number), an aggregator node will:

1. Wait to receive data from **all** of its direct children for that sequence.  
2. Combine those child values into a partial aggregate (e.g., compute their sum).  
3. Forward a **single** aggregated Data packet upward to its parent (representing the aggregated result for that slot).

This behavior occurs recursively from the leaves up to the root for every time slot. In effect, at each time slot, all child contributions are merged into one Data packet before moving upward, reducing bandwidth usage toward the root.

- **Communication Flow**:  
  - The **root** (consumer) sends an Interest for a given sequence number, which is propagated down the tree (via NDN forwarding).  
  - The producer leaves generate Data in response to that Interest (each with their value for the requested sequence).  
  - Intermediate **aggregators** intercept their children’s Data packets, aggregate the values, and then satisfy their parent’s Interest by returning a single Data packet carrying the aggregated value.  
- **End Result**: Each sequence number (time slot) yields **exactly one** Data packet delivered to the root, containing the aggregated value of all producers’ contributions for that slot.

### Per-Node Responsibilities

*Responsibilities of each node type during the aggregation process:*  
- Producers respond to incoming Interests by providing their local data values for the corresponding sequence.  
- Aggregators forward Interests to children, wait for all child Data, aggregate them, and send the result up.  
- The root sends out Interests for each new sequence and receives one aggregated Data for each.

*Each node acts according to its role to ensure that for every time slot the data from all producers is combined exactly once at each level of the tree.*

---

## Aggregation Buffer Design

Each aggregator node maintains an **aggregation buffer** to manage in-flight data for ongoing sequences. The buffer is essentially a table of partial aggregates, where each entry corresponds to one sequence number currently being processed. For each active sequence entry, the buffer tracks:

- **Sequence ID** – the sequence number (time slot) of the data being aggregated.  
- **Count of Child Contributions Received** – how many child Data packets for this sequence have arrived so far.  
- **Partial Aggregate Value** – the running sum (or other aggregate) of the values received so far for this sequence.  
- *(Straggler timing info)* – a timer or expiration timestamp to detect if this sequence is taking too long (used to decide when to stop waiting for missing children, see Straggler Management below).

The buffer has a fixed **capacity** (e.g., it can hold entries for up to 100 concurrent sequences). If new sequence Interests arrive such that the buffer is full, the system must handle it gracefully:

- If the buffer is at capacity and a new Interest for a further (newer) sequence arrives, the aggregator should **immediately send a NACK** (Negative Acknowledgment) upstream for that Interest, indicating it cannot be processed due to resource limits (buffer overflow).
- This NACK serves as a signal to the parent (or ultimately the root) to slow down or retry that Interest later.
- Completed sequence entries should be removed from the buffer as soon as their aggregation is finished and the aggregated result is sent upward, freeing that buffer slot.
- The system should avoid initiating more concurrent sequences than the buffer can hold. In practice, this means the root (or parent nodes) should wait until some ongoing sequence finishes (freeing a buffer entry) before requesting a new one. If the buffer is full of active entries and a new Interest arrives, the aggregator NACKs it rather than dropping an existing entry.
- By promptly freeing completed entries and using flow control (described next) to pace new requests, the buffer can operate without overflowing.

---

## Flow Control and Congestion Control

To prevent overfilling buffers or overwhelming network links, the system will incorporate a flow control mechanism integrated with **congestion control**. Key points:

- The implementation should support multiple congestion control algorithms, which can be easily swapped or configured (i.e., **pluggable** congestion control strategies).
- Possible algorithms include traditional AIMD-based schemes and more modern ones, for example:  
  - **AIMD** (Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease): Gradually increase sending rate/window, but cut it multiplicatively upon detecting congestion (similar to classic TCP behavior).  
  - **TCP Reno/Cubic**: Standard TCP-like congestion control behaviors adapted for NDN Interests (e.g., Reno with slow start and AIMD, or Cubic with a cubic growth curve for the congestion window).  
  - **BBR** (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT): A modern rate-based control algorithm that estimates available bandwidth and round-trip time to set the sending rate accordingly.
- The congestion control should regulate the rate at which Interests are sent (i.e., how many Interests can be in flight) by consumers at various levels of the tree (root and possibly aggregators, depending on the model chosen—see **Congestion Control Models** below).
- It may use feedback signals like NACKs or measured timeouts/RTTs to adjust the sending rate. For example, if an aggregator sends Interests to its children too quickly and its buffer fills up, it will send NACKs upstream; the parent (or root) receiving those NACKs should interpret them as a congestion signal and throttle its request rate.

### NACK Usage

NDN’s NACK packets are used in this system to explicitly signal two distinct types of issues, each with a different **reason code**. Differentiating NACK reasons ensures that congestion control algorithms react only to actual network congestion and not to data unavailability problems. Specifically:

- **Buffer Overflow / Congestion**:  
  - If an aggregator’s buffer capacity is exceeded or it cannot accept a new Interest due to overload, the aggregator replies with a NACK (Reason: e.g., “Congestion”) instead of silently dropping the Interest.  
  - The upstream node (parent or root) receiving this NACK interprets it as a sign of congestion.  
  - The congestion control mechanism should respond by **throttling the Interest sending rate** (e.g., reducing its window or pausing new Interests) and later retrying the Interest when conditions improve.
- **Incomplete Aggregation (No Data)**:  
  - If an aggregator cannot produce an aggregated Data result because one or more child responses are missing or excessively delayed (i.e., the aggregator doesn’t have all data for that sequence), it sends a NACK upstream with a reason code indicating **data unavailability** (e.g., “NoData”).  
  - This NACK tells the parent that the requested data segment could not be provided due to missing inputs, but it is **not** a signal of network congestion.  
  - The congestion control algorithm at the parent must **not** treat a “NoData” NACK as a congestion signal. In other words, the parent should **not** reduce its sending rate when it receives a NoData NACK.  
  - Instead, the system can handle this scenario by other means (for example, the root might log the missing segment or retry the Interest for that segment after a delay) without adjusting the overall flow rate.
- **NACK Reason Codes & Rate Control**:  
  - All NACKs are tagged with a specific reason code to distinguish their cause.  
  - Only **congestion-related NACKs** (e.g., those with reason “Congestion”) should trigger the congestion control to slow down sending new Interests.  
  - **Data-unavailability NACKs** (e.g., “NoData” due to an incomplete aggregation) should be handled gracefully (the system might retry or skip that segment later) but must **not** cause a congestion window reduction or rate decrease.  
  - This approach cleanly separates true network congestion signals from content unavailability signals, preventing misinterpretation of why a NACK was sent.

### Congestion Control Models

The implementation should be flexible to support different scopes for applying congestion control in the aggregation tree. Three models are considered:

1. **Root-Only Congestion Control**:  
   - Only the root (top-level consumer) runs a congestion control algorithm, adjusting the global request rate for new data segments.  
   - Intermediate aggregators do not independently throttle request sending; they simply propagate Interests as they receive them (aside from buffering constraints). The root node manages overall flow based on end-to-end feedback (e.g., it will slow down if it receives congestion NACKs or observes increased delays).
2. **Per-Parent Congestion Control**:  
   - Every aggregator (every node that has children) independently manages congestion control for the flow of Interests it sends to its children.  
   - In practice, each parent node monitors the rate of incoming Data from its children and controls the rate at which it issues Interests to those children to avoid overwhelming its own buffers or links.  
   - This distributes congestion control throughout the tree, with each aggregator ensuring it doesn’t overwhelm its downstream network. The root still controls the top-level rate, but each subtree is also locally regulated.
3. **Coordinator-Aware Congestion Control**:  
   - A coordinated approach where a designated entity (possibly the root or a dedicated coordinator node) has a network-wide view of congestion and orchestrates control decisions.  
   - The coordinator can adjust interest sending rates at multiple points in the tree based on global state or combined signals from various nodes.  
   - This may involve explicit communication of congestion information up the tree and control commands down the tree.  
   - Two feedback strategies can be considered:  
     - **One-hop feedback**: Each node provides congestion signals only to its direct parent (or the coordinator). Control decisions are made on a local parent-child basis.  
     - **Deep-layer feedback**: Congestion information from deeper in the network is propagated all the way up to the coordinator, giving it a global perspective to make decisions.  
   - One-hop feedback offers localized control, whereas deep-layer feedback allows the coordinator to make decisions with a more holistic view. In this model, congestion control decisions are made with awareness of the entire aggregation structure, not just local conditions.

The system should allow one of these models to be selected (either at compile time or run time via configuration) to govern how congestion control is applied across the system.

## Straggler Management Module

A **straggler** refers to a child data packet that does not arrive within a reasonable time window for its sequence. The Straggler Management module ensures an aggregator does not wait indefinitely for missing or slow responses from children. (If this module is disabled, an aggregator with missing child data would eventually send a "NoData" NACK upstream as described above; when enabled, the aggregator instead follows the strategy below.)

At each aggregator, a timer is associated with each sequence (time slot) being aggregated. If not all expected child Data packets for a given sequence arrive before the timer expires, the aggregator triggers a straggler-handling procedure:

- **Timeout Detection**: When an aggregator forwards Interests for sequence **N** to its children, it starts a countdown timer for that sequence.
- **Trigger on Expiry**: If the timer expires before all child responses for **N** are received, the aggregator deems the remaining missing responses as stragglers.
- **Partial Result on Straggler**: Rather than sending a NACK upstream in this case, the aggregator immediately finalizes the partial aggregate using whatever child data has arrived on time and forwards this partial result to its parent (as a Data packet for sequence **N**).
- **Embedded Straggler List**: The Data packet carrying a partial aggregate includes an embedded list of any **straggler child node names/IDs** in its content payload. This list identifies which children’s data did not arrive in time. By including this information, the receiving node (ultimately the root) is informed of exactly which child contributions were missing.
- **Handling Late Arrivals**: If a straggler’s Data arrives **after** the aggregator has already sent the partial result for that sequence, the aggregator forwards the late Data **directly to the root**, bypassing further aggregation. In other words, once an aggregator has moved on after timing out, any subsequent Data for that sequence is sent upstream on its own. This ensures late contributions are not lost; they reach the root without delaying or interfering with new sequence aggregations.

This mechanism prevents a single slow child from stalling the entire system. The timeout should be configured to be long enough for normal network delays but short enough to detect true stragglers. Using this strategy, the aggregator never waits indefinitely: it either gets all child data and aggregates normally, or it times out and sends what it has (notifying about missing pieces). The root (or parent) can then decide how to handle any straggler notifications (e.g., it might issue follow-up Interests directly to those straggler children to retrieve missing data if desired).

*Note:* The `config.txt` configuration (described later) allows the Straggler Management module to be enabled or disabled. Disabling it would mean the aggregator falls back to sending an upstream "NoData" NACK when children are missing, rather than partial results.

## Trace Class Module

To evaluate correctness and performance, the system will include a **Trace module** (tracing utility) that records key information during the simulation. This module logs events and metrics without altering the protocol’s operation, enabling post-simulation analysis for debugging and verification. The tracing component provides several capabilities:

- **Correct Sum Trace**: Validates the aggregated results for each sequence against expected values. If producers generate data following a known pattern (so the true sum for each sequence is known), the tracer can compute the expected total and the expected number of contributors for that sequence. It then compares the final aggregated sum and the count of data packets received at the root to these expected values, logging a warning or error if any discrepancy is found. This helps ensure the aggregation process correctly sums inputs and that no contributions are lost.
- **Aggregation Completion Summary**: Tracks which sequences (time slots) have been fully processed by each aggregator. For each aggregator node, the trace can record the ranges of sequence numbers for which aggregation was completed. For example, an aggregator might log that it successfully aggregated sequences 1–100, then 102–150, etc., rather than listing every sequence. This summary quickly reveals if any sequence numbers were skipped or significantly delayed at a particular aggregator, highlighting gaps in the aggregation timeline.
- **Link Throughput**: Measures the data throughput over time on selected network links. The trace will record the amount of data passing through each monitored link during the simulation (e.g., in fixed time intervals), especially for critical links (such as those near the root). By default, it might track all links connected to the root. This helps in understanding network load and identifying potential bottlenecks by showing the rate (e.g., in Mbps or packets per second) at which data travels on those links over time.
- **System Metrics**: Provides high-level performance statistics for the simulation run. Examples of metrics include:  
  - **Total Aggregation Time**: The time taken to complete one full aggregation cycle for a sequence (from when the root requests a segment to when the final aggregated Data arrives at the root). This could be logged per sequence or averaged over all sequences.  
  - **System Throughput**: The overall rate of delivering aggregated results to the root (e.g., number of aggregated results per second). This indicates how quickly the system is producing final results.  
  - **Bandwidth Utilization**: The fraction of network link capacity being used, typically for key links (like near the root). The trace can calculate utilization by comparing observed throughput against the link’s maximum bandwidth.  
  - **Accuracy**: A measure of correctness of the aggregated data, focusing on the difference in average aggregated values caused by missing or delayed producer data. Specifically, accuracy compares two key metrics:
   - **Expected Average Value**: The sum of values from all producers divided by the total number of producers.
   - **Actual Average Value**: The aggregated sum actually received divided by the number of producers whose data arrived on time (excluding stragglers).
   Mathematically, accuracy is defined as:
   \[
   \text{Accuracy} = \left|\frac{\text{Expected Total Sum}}{\text{Total Number of Producers}} - \frac{\text{Actual Received Sum}}{\text{Number of Actual Aggregated Producers}}\right|
   \]
   Ideally, accuracy should approach zero if all data arrives correctly. Higher values indicate a significant impact from missing or delayed producer data on the overall aggregated result.

The Trace module can be implemented by hooking into events in the CFNAgg application (e.g., when data is aggregated, when an Interest times out, when a Data is received at the root) and writing logs to a file or console. It does not interfere with normal packet processing, but provides a record to verify that every expected aggregation occurred correctly and to analyze performance characteristics of the system.

## Changing Bandwidth Test

To evaluate **CFNAgg** under varying network conditions, the simulation can optionally introduce **dynamic link bandwidth changes** during runtime. This feature allows testing how the aggregation system performs when network capacity fluctuates (e.g., due to congestion, link degradation, or scheduled upgrades).

By default, all links use fixed bandwidth values as specified in the topology input. The dynamic bandwidth mode is *disabled by default* to ensure a controlled baseline. When explicitly enabled, the simulation scenario can schedule events to modify link parameters at specified simulation times. For instance, using NS-3’s event scheduler, one could programmatically reduce a particular link’s data rate from 10 Mbps to 1 Mbps at simulation time 5 seconds, then restore it to 10 Mbps at 10 seconds.

Such adjustments would be done by modifying the NS-3 NetDevice or channel attributes (e.g., using `Simulator::Schedule` to call a function that sets a new DataRate on a `PointToPointNetDevice`). Because this involves NS-3 commands, it is configured in the scenario code (not via the static topology files) when setting up the simulation.

Typical use cases for the **Changing Bandwidth Test** include:

- Stress-testing the aggregation logic under sudden drops in available bandwidth (to see if the system can cope or how performance degrades).
- Simulating link failures or severe congestion by drastically lowering bandwidth, and then simulating recovery by raising it back.
- Evaluating how well the congestion control adapts to changing network capacity.

In summary, this feature allows runtime variation of network conditions, but should be used carefully to isolate its effects. It is turned off unless needed for a specific experiment, to keep default behavior deterministic.

---

## System Parameters

Key simulation parameters should be defined for easy configuration and tuning:

- **Total Aggregation Iterations**: The number of time slots (rounds of aggregation) to simulate. For example, a default might be 10,000 iterations, meaning the system will aggregate data for sequence numbers 1 through 10,000. This essentially determines how long the consumer will keep requesting data (and thus how many aggregation cycles will occur).
- **Data Value Type**:  
  - **Numeric Vector Structure**: Each Data packet can carry a vector of numeric values (e.g., multiple sensor readings). The number of values (vector length) per packet is configurable. Aggregation operations (e.g., summation) are performed element-wise across these vectors.  
  - **Numeric Precision**: All values use a fixed numeric type for computation—by default, 64-bit double precision is used to ensure accuracy and avoid overflow when aggregating many values. (32-bit floats could be used for smaller-scale data, but double precision is preferred for safety.)  
  - **Straggler Information**: If the Straggler Management module triggers a partial result, the Data packet’s content payload will include the list of straggler child node names (as described earlier). This list is embedded in the Data content itself (to keep the packet format standard). If there are no stragglers for a given Data packet, no such list is included (the Data contains only the numeric values as usual).
- **Aggregation Buffer Size**: The capacity of each aggregator’s buffer (in number of entries). For example, if set to 100, an aggregator can handle up to 100 different sequence numbers in progress at the same time. This effectively caps how far ahead in time the system can pipeline requests. If the root tries to have more than 100 outstanding sequences concurrently, the 101st Interest will be NACKed due to buffer overflow. This parameter can be adjusted to study trade-offs between concurrency and resource usage.
- **Other Network Parameters**: Link bandwidths, propagation delays, and queue sizes are specified by the topology input (see **Topology Input Format** below). By default, these remain fixed during the simulation. Optionally, dynamic changes to link parameters can be introduced at runtime (if the Changing Bandwidth Test feature is enabled) to emulate varying conditions.
- **Configurability**: Ensure that all the above parameters are easy to locate and modify – for example, via constants in a header, command-line arguments, or NS-3 configuration attributes. This makes it convenient to run experiments with different settings without changing code.

---

## Topology Input Format

The network topology and the aggregation tree structure are defined in external input files (rather than being hard-coded). The program will read these files at startup to construct the simulation environment. The input files are:

1. **`dcn.txt` (Data Center Network Topology)** – Defines the nodes in the simulation and the point-to-point links between them, along with link attributes. Each line in this file describes either a node or a link. For links, a line lists two node names (or IDs) and the link parameters (bandwidth, propagation delay, link cost if used, and queue size). For example:  
   `NodeA NodeB 10Mbps 2ms 1 50`  
   This indicates a link between `NodeA` and `NodeB` with 10 Mbps bandwidth, 2 ms propagation delay, a cost metric of 1, and a queue size of 50 packets. The topology parser should create the nodes (if not already created) and then create an NS-3 point-to-point link between these two nodes with the specified characteristics. The `dcn.txt` file essentially describes the physical network layout.

2. **`aggtree-dcn.txt` (Aggregation Tree Definition)** – Defines the parent-child relationships forming the aggregation tree on top of the physical topology. Each entry in this file specifies a parent node and its children in the aggregation hierarchy. For example, a line might be:  
   `ParentNode Child1 Child2 Child3`  
   meaning that `ParentNode` aggregates data from `Child1`, `Child2`, and `Child3`. Using this information, the simulation will assign roles to each node:  
   - Nodes that appear only as children (and never as a parent) in this file are **producer leaves** (they have no children in the aggregation tree).  
   - Nodes that appear as a parent (with one or more listed children) are **aggregators**. They expect data from those children and will aggregate and forward results upward. (A node can be an aggregator even if it is at the edge of the physical topology; the roles are logical.)  
   - The one node that is not listed as anyone’s child (appears only as a parent, or not at all as a child) is the **root (consumer)** of the aggregation tree.  
   The implementation should parse this file and build a data structure (e.g., an adjacency list or mapping) that represents the aggregation tree. This structure informs the CFNAgg application which nodes it should send Interests to (its children) and from which nodes to expect Data.

3. **`config.txt` (System Configuration Parameters)** – Specifies various configuration flags and parameters to enable/disable features or set certain algorithms. For example, this file might contain lines to toggle straggler management, choose a congestion control algorithm, or enable dynamic bandwidth changes. A sample configuration line could be:  

StragglerManagement Enabled CongestionControl AIMD DynamicBandwidth Disabled

This example indicates that the Straggler Management module should be enabled, the congestion control strategy should be AIMD, and the dynamic bandwidth feature is disabled.  
- `StragglerManagement`: **Enabled** or **Disabled** – turns the Straggler Management module on or off (allowing comparison of runs with and without explicit straggler handling).  
- `CongestionControl`: specifies which congestion control algorithm to use globally (e.g., **AIMD**, **Reno**, **Cubic**, **BBR**, etc.). This would tell the application which congestion control strategy class to instantiate.  
- `DynamicBandwidth`: **Enabled** or **Disabled** – whether to activate the Changing Bandwidth Test feature. If enabled, the simulation scenario will apply programmed changes to link bandwidths during runtime (as described above). If disabled, all links stay at their fixed bandwidths.  
The implementation should parse this config file and configure the simulation run accordingly (set flags or select the appropriate strategy implementations based on these values).

Using external files for topology and configuration allows the system to simulate different network layouts and parameter settings without changing the source code—simply by supplying different input files. The program will:  
- Read `dcn.txt` to create all nodes and links in the NS-3 simulator.  
- Read `aggtree-dcn.txt` to assign each node its role (producer, aggregator, or root) and configure the CFNAgg application on that node accordingly.  
- Read `config.txt` to enable/disable modules (like straggler management, dynamic bandwidth) and choose algorithms (like which congestion control strategy to use).  
After this initialization, the simulation scenario code can proceed to install the CFNAgg application on the nodes with the appropriate configuration.

*Note:* Dynamic link changes (bandwidth adjustments during the run) are not specified in the static files but can be activated via the `DynamicBandwidth` flag and implemented by scheduling events in the scenario code (see **Changing Bandwidth Test** section). This separation ensures the base topology remains in files, while dynamic behavior is an optional scenario-specific addition.

## ndnSIM Integration Guidelines

To implement CFNAgg within **ndnSIM 2.9**, follow standard ndnSIM coding patterns and place new code in the appropriate directories of the ndnSIM module structure. The CFNAgg functionality will consist of one or more custom NDN applications and several support classes. Organize the code as follows:

1. **ndnSIM Applications**: Create the CFNAgg application(s) under `src/ndnSIM/apps/` in the ndnSIM codebase.  
- You may implement a single application class (e.g., a `CfnAggApp`) that can operate in different modes (producer, aggregator, or root) depending on how it’s configured, *or* implement separate application classes for the producer, aggregator, and consumer roles.  
- These classes should inherit from `ns3::ndn::App` so that they integrate with ndnSIM’s NDN stack and can send/receive Interests and Data.  
- *Example:* You might create `CfnAggApp.hpp/cpp` as the main application implementing the aggregator logic (and possibly also used for the root and producer by configuration). Optionally, you could create a specialized `CfnProducerApp` for pure producer nodes (leaf data sources) and perhaps a separate mode or class for the root consumer logic if needed. The choice depends on whether a single flexible class or multiple specialized classes makes the implementation clearer.
2. **Utility/Helper Classes**: Implement reusable components (like buffers, controllers, and managers) in separate modules under `src/ndnSIM/utils/` or `src/ndnSIM/helper/`.  
- **AggregationBuffer.hpp/cpp**: Defines the buffer data structure and methods for managing partial aggregates (inserting child data, checking completion, handling overflow conditions, etc.). The CFNAgg app will use this to track and combine incoming Data from children.  
- **CongestionController.hpp/cpp** (and specific strategy implementations): Defines an interface for congestion control strategies (e.g., methods to update on data ack or NACK, and to determine if a new Interest can be sent). Implement concrete subclasses for each algorithm (e.g., `AimdCc`, `RenoCc`, `CubicCc`, `BbrCc`) that encapsulate their respective logic. This allows the CFNAgg app to plug in the chosen algorithm.  
- **StragglerManager.hpp/cpp**: Contains logic to detect and handle stragglers as described. It can track outstanding sequences and trigger actions (like finalizing partial results or issuing NACKs) if children don't respond in time. This could be integrated into the main app or kept separate for clarity.  
- **TraceCollector.hpp/cpp**: Provides functionality for logging/tracing events. For example, it might record when an aggregated Data arrives at the root, or when an Interest times out or a NACK is sent/received, etc. This helps gather statistics for analysis without cluttering the main logic.  
- Additional helpers can be created as needed, for example a `TopologyReader` utility to parse the topology files (`dcn.txt` and `aggtree-dcn.txt`) and set up the NS-3 nodes and links. Placing this in utils can keep the scenario code cleaner.
3. **Example Scenario**: Provide a simulation scenario program (under `src/ndnSIM/examples/`) that ties everything together for testing. For instance, `cfnagg-simulation.cpp` can be created to:  
- Read the input files (topology and config) and construct the network topology using NS-3 (creating Node objects, setting up point-to-point channels with parameters from `dcn.txt`).  
- Use the aggregation tree definition to install the CFNAgg application on each node with the proper configuration (e.g., set nodes with no children as producers, designate the root, etc.).  
- Configure global parameters (like total iterations to request, buffer size, which congestion control strategy to use, whether straggler management is enabled, etc.), possibly via command-line arguments or directly in the code, using the parsed `config.txt` values.  
- Run the simulation for the required number of iterations and perhaps print or log key results (like confirming that the root received all expected aggregated Data or measuring performance metrics via the Trace module).  
- The example scenario will serve as a demonstration that the CFNAgg system works end-to-end and as a template for users to create their own scenarios.

All new code should be made **compatible with ndnSIM 2.9** (which corresponds to NFD version 22.02 and associated ndn-cxx libraries). Use ndnSIM’s logging framework (`NS_LOG_*` macros) and configuration system (`Config::Set` or the ns-3 `CommandLine` arguments) as appropriate so that behavior can be observed and tuned. The new classes should integrate cleanly with ndnSIM’s build (you may need to update `wscript`/CMake files to include the new sources). Following ndnSIM’s conventions will ensure that other researchers/users can incorporate CFNAgg into their simulations by adding the module or copying the app and utils into their ndnSIM environment and rebuilding.

## Code Structure Requirements

The implementation should be broken into **modular components**, each in separate header/source files for clarity. **Do not write one monolithic file.** Below is the recommended code structure and the responsibilities of each component:

1. **Aggregation Application** (`.hpp` & `.cpp`):  
- Core NDN application logic for CFNAgg, implemented as a subclass of `ndn::App`.  
- **Consumer side** (at the root, or at an aggregator receiving requests from its parent): Responsible for sending Interests for new data segments when allowed by the congestion control window, and handling incoming aggregated Data from its children (or final results at the root).  
- **Producer side** (at leaf producers, or at an aggregator responding to its parent): Upon receiving an Interest for sequence **N** from its parent, the node must provide the Data for that Interest.  
  - If the node has no children (leaf producer), it immediately generates and returns a Data packet with the local value for sequence N.  
  - If the node has children (aggregator), it forwards Interests for **N** to all children, waits for their responses, and uses the AggregationBuffer to store incoming values. Once all child Data for N are received (or straggler timeout occurs), it creates the aggregated Data packet (with combined value and any straggler info) and sends it upward to satisfy the Interest.  
- The application should handle error cases:  
  - If a child does not respond before timeout, invoke the straggler mechanism (or, if disabled, send a NACK upstream for no data).  
  - If a child sends a NACK, treat it as an indication that the child's data is unavailable; the aggregator can propagate a NACK or trigger straggler handling as appropriate.  
- Distinguish roles by configuration (or by the presence/absence of children and parent): e.g., a node with no children is a producer, the node with no parent is the root, and others are aggregators. The application logic can branch based on role where needed.
2. **AggregationBuffer** (`.hpp` & `.cpp`):  
- Data structure for storing partial aggregates at an aggregator.  
- Provides methods such as:  
  - `insertData(seq, value)`: Add a child’s data value for the given sequence number into the buffer (update the partial aggregate and count of received contributions).  
  - `isComplete(seq)`: Check if all expected children’s data for sequence have been received (requires knowing the number of children).  
  - `getAggregate(seq)`: Once complete, compute or retrieve the final aggregate value for that sequence (e.g., the sum of all child values).  
  - `remove(seq)`: Remove the entry for that sequence (after the aggregated result is sent upward or if the aggregation is aborted).  
- Enforces the capacity limit for concurrent sequences. If the buffer is full (max number of in-progress sequences) and a new Interest arrives for a different sequence not currently in the buffer, this triggers a buffer overflow condition:  
  - The aggregator should send an upstream NACK (with reason code indicating congestion/overflow) for that new Interest instead of adding it to the buffer.  
  - (One could implement a policy to drop the oldest entry in favor of a new one, but the preferred approach is to simply not accept new sequences beyond the capacity; rely on higher-level flow control to prevent this situation.)
3. **Congestion Control Strategy** (interface and implementations) (`.hpp` & `.cpp`):  
- An abstract interface class (e.g., `CongestionControlStrategy`) defining how the application controls its Interest sending rate/window.  
- Include methods for reacting to network events, for example:  
  - `OnDataAck(sequence)` – called when a Data for a given sequence is received (acknowledging that an Interest was satisfied successfully).  
  - `OnNack(sequence, reason)` – called when a NACK is received for a given sequence (with information on whether it was congestion or no-data).  
  - `OnTimeout(sequence)` – called when an Interest times out (no response in expected time).  
  - `CanSendInterest()` or similar – to decide if the window allows sending another Interest (or to get the current congestion window size).  
- The strategy class maintains state like a congestion window or rate counter to implement control algorithms.  
- Provide concrete implementations for at least the following algorithms:  
  - **AIMD** (e.g., TCP Reno-style additive increase, multiplicative decrease on signals of loss/congestion).  
  - **Cubic** (TCP Cubic’s congestion window adjustment algorithm, if applicable to NDN Interests).  
  - **BBR** (modeling rate based on Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT estimation).  
- The application should be able to select which strategy to use via a configuration setting (for example, an enum in config or a class factory that instantiates the chosen strategy). This makes the congestion control *pluggable*.  
- Ensure the congestion control design supports the different **models** described earlier (root-only vs per-parent vs coordinator-aware). For instance:  
  - In **root-only** mode, only the root node would use the congestion controller to limit Interests; aggregators would send Interests to children as soon as they receive an Interest from their parent (except limited by their buffer).  
  - In **per-parent** mode, each aggregator would also have its own congestion controller instance to manage the flow to its children, functioning similarly to how the root controls flow to top-level children.  
  - A **coordinator-aware** mode might require additional logic to propagate congestion signals upward and coordinate decisions at the root (or a central controller). This could be implemented as an extension where needed (possibly beyond the basic requirement).
4. **StragglerManager** (`.hpp` & `.cpp`):  
- Module to handle stragglers (slow/missing child responses) for aggregators. It works closely with the application and buffer.  
- Responsibilities include:  
  - Starting a timer whenever an Interest is sent to children for a new sequence.  
  - Detecting stragglers: if the timer expires before all children reply, identify which children did not respond in time.  
  - On timeout, triggering the aggregator to finalize the partial aggregate and send the result upward immediately (with the list of straggler children embedded in the Data, as described in the design).  
  - Handling late arrivals: if a child’s Data comes in after the timeout, ensure that data is forwarded directly to the root (so it’s not lost and can be accounted for at the consumer level).  
  - Providing an interface to configure the timeout duration (and any other straggler-related parameters) so that it can be tuned.  
- This module can be enabled or disabled via configuration. When disabled, the aggregator would instead use the simpler approach of sending a "NoData" NACK upstream if a child doesn’t respond.
5. **Topology Parsing & Setup**:  
- Code to parse the input files (`dcn.txt` and `aggtree-dcn.txt`) and set up the NS-3 network and node roles accordingly. This can be done in the example scenario code or in a helper class.  
- This includes creating all nodes and links as specified in the topology file and installing/configuring the CFNAgg application on each node based on the aggregation tree file (assigning parent/child relationships, etc.).  
- Ensure the parsing code is robust (able to handle various topology sizes) and clearly documented, so users can modify the input files format if needed.
6. **Tracing Module** (`TraceCollector.hpp/cpp`):  
- Component to log simulation events and metrics without disturbing protocol operation.  
- Implement as a class that can hook into the CFNAgg application’s events (perhaps via callbacks or direct calls at key points) to record information like:  
  - When the root receives an aggregated Data packet (log the sequence number and reception time).  
  - When an aggregator finishes aggregating a sequence (log that sequence as completed at that node).  
  - When an Interest times out or a NACK is received at any level (log the event and reason).  
- The TraceCollector can compile these logs into metrics such as latency per sequence, overall throughput of the system (e.g., aggregates/second at the root), and any occurrences of straggler events or NACKs.  
- This helps in post-run analysis to verify that all expected data was received and to quantify performance (the tracing logic itself should be independent of the core algorithm, only observing events).

*All components above should be designed with clear interfaces and separation of concerns.* For example, the Aggregation app uses a congestion control interface without needing to know the details of a particular algorithm, and it uses the AggregationBuffer to manage data without knowing how it's implemented internally. This modular design makes it easier to extend or modify parts of the system (for instance, adding a new aggregation function or congestion control algorithm) without affecting other components.

### Application Layer Implementation

It is crucial that all CFNAgg logic is implemented at the NDN **application layer**. **Do not** modify the NDN forwarding daemon (NFD) or lower network layers. Instead, leverage ndnSIM’s application API to send and receive packets. For example:

- Use `ndn::App::SendInterest()` from the application to express Interests (down the network stack) to the node’s children (or from the root to the network).
- Override `OnInterest()` in the application class to handle incoming Interest packets at producers or aggregators (this is where a producer would generate data, or an aggregator would forward the Interest to its children).
- Override `OnData()` in the application to handle incoming Data packets from children at an aggregator (collecting them for aggregation) or the final Data at the root.
- Use `ndn::App::SendData()` to send Data packets (with aggregated content) from an aggregator up to its parent (or from a producer to answer the Interest).
- Override `OnNack()` to handle NACK packets coming from children (so that the aggregator knows a child couldn’t satisfy an Interest, and can react accordingly, e.g., treat it as missing data or congestion signal).

By keeping the implementation in the application layer, we rely on NDN’s existing forwarding logic (PIT, FIB, etc.) and do not need to alter any router internals. The CFNAgg application essentially decides **when** to send Interests and **how** to aggregate Data, while normal NDN forwarding delivers those Interests and Data through the network.

### Configurability

The code should allow easy configuration of key features, preferably via the input files or command-line parameters, rather than requiring code changes. In particular:

- The **congestion control strategy** and model should be selectable. For example, one should be able to choose AIMD vs Cubic vs BBR, and whether to apply it at the root-only or per-parent, by changing a setting (such as in `config.txt` or a command-line argument) rather than editing code.
- The straggler handling feature should be toggleable (enabled/disabled via config), as mentioned.
- Parameters like the aggregation buffer size, number of iterations, and timers (straggler timeout) should be settable via configuration or command line.
- This flexibility will make it easier to experiment with different algorithms and settings, and to use the CFNAgg code in different scenarios without recompiling for each change.

## Trace Class Module

To facilitate debugging and performance evaluation, the CFNAgg system includes a tracing mechanism that logs important events during the simulation run (without affecting protocol behavior). For example, the tracer can record:

- When the root receives each aggregated Data packet (noting the sequence number and reception time, to compute latency and throughput).
- When an Interest times out or a NACK is received at any node (indicating a missing data or congestion event for that sequence).
- When an aggregator completes processing a particular sequence (helpful to verify that every time slot was handled).

This logging is implemented by hooking into the CFNAgg application’s event handlers (e.g., in `OnData`, `OnTimeout`, `OnNack`) and writing details to a log file or console. The trace output can later be analyzed to ensure that all expected aggregated results were produced and to measure performance metrics (such as per-sequence delay, overall throughput, and occurrences of stragglers or congestion signals). In summary, the Trace module provides a valuable record for verifying correctness and understanding system behavior in the simulation.

## Output Expectations

The final output from the LLM given this prompt should include all components necessary to build and run the CFNAgg simulation in ndnSIM 2.9. Specifically, the answer should contain:

1. **Source Code Files**: Complete C++ header (`.hpp`) and source (`.cpp`) files for all the modules described above, including:  
- The CFNAgg **application class(es)** (e.g., `CfnAggApp.hpp` and `CfnAggApp.cpp`).  
- The **AggregationBuffer** class (`AggregationBuffer.hpp`/`.cpp`).  
- The **Congestion Control** interface and implementations (e.g., `CongestionControlStrategy.hpp`/`.cpp` and concrete strategy classes like `AimdStrategy.cpp`, `CubicStrategy.cpp`, etc.).  
- The **Straggler Management** module (e.g., a `StragglerManager.hpp`/`.cpp` or equivalent logic integrated into the app).  
- The **Tracing utility** (e.g., `TraceCollector.hpp`/`.cpp` class for logging events).  
- Any additional helpers (for example, a topology file parser `TopologyReader.hpp`/`.cpp` if one is used for reading the input files).
2. **Simulation Scenario File**: A C++ main program (e.g., `cfnagg-simulation.cpp`) that sets up and runs a sample simulation using the above components. This should:  
- Parse input arguments or use hardcoded file names to locate `dcn.txt` and `aggtree-dcn.txt` (and possibly `config.txt`).  
- Read the topology files and create the nodes and links in ns-3 accordingly.  
- Assign roles to nodes and install the CFNAgg application on each (configure each app instance as producer, aggregator, or root based on the aggregation tree file).  
- Set the simulation parameters (total iterations, buffer size, selected congestion control algorithm/model, straggler timeout, etc.).  
- Start the simulation and run it until all requested iterations are completed, ensuring the consumer (root) receives all the expected aggregated Data packets.  
- Possibly print or log some output at the end (such as confirmation of completion or some performance stats collected by the Trace module) to verify correct operation.
3. **README.md**: A Markdown document explaining how to compile and use the provided code. It should include:  
- **Overview of Components**: A brief description of each source file and class (e.g., "`CfnAggApp`: the main NDN application implementing producer/aggregator/root roles", "`AggregationBuffer`: buffer for partial aggregates", "`AimdStrategy`: congestion control algorithm using AIMD", etc.).  
- **Interaction Flow**: An explanation of how the data flows in the system when running (for example, detailing the sequence of events from the root sending an Interest to getting the aggregated Data, and how the modules like buffer, congestion control, and straggler manager interact).  
- **Build Instructions**: How to integrate these files into ndnSIM 2.9 and compile. For instance, mention if certain files need to be placed in specific directories (as per the guidelines above) and if any build scripts (waf/CMake) need to be updated, or if the code can be compiled by adding it to an existing ndnSIM project.  
- **Run Instructions**: How to run the example simulation. This may include the `waf` execution command and any required arguments (for instance, specifying the paths to the input files and any parameters like number of iterations or which CC algorithm to use). Also describe what output or logs to expect, and how to interpret them (especially any output from the Trace module verifying correctness).  
- **Configuration Options**: Document the parameters that can be adjusted (from `config.txt` or otherwise) such as enabling/disabling straggler management, switching congestion control algorithms, changing buffer size, etc., and how to do so.

All code should be **well-commented** for clarity and understanding. The answer should present the code in a structured way, with each file clearly separated (for example, using Markdown code blocks labeled with the filename). The final deliverable should allow a developer to copy the files into an ndnSIM 2.9 workspace, compile them, and run the provided scenario to observe a working CFNAgg distributed aggregation system.

**End of Prompt.**

Use this specification to generate a complete CFNAgg solution (source code and README) for ndnSIM 2.9. Good luck!
