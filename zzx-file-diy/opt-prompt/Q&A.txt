Thanks for the detailed context and uploads. To pinpoint the exact issue causing the segmentation fault in optimized mode, I need to know:

Have you observed whether the bug occurs consistently for a specific sequence number or event (e.g. timeout, receiving a specific Data packet)?

Could you share whether the issue happens during aggregation completion or during the straggler timeout path?

Are you using any custom strategy, or just relying on the default BestRoute strategy throughout?

Once I have this, Iâ€™ll walk through the exact line and patch to fix the root cause.



1. Under the optimized mode, the "agg-mini-simulation.cpp" cannot even run. However, it can successfully run and output log under the -d debug mode.

2. All the message is provided in the "Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault." I mention above. 
Under the -d debug mode, the programe can run normally as:
Use 'set logging enabled on'.

warning: Currently logging to gdb.txt.  Turn the logging off and on to make the new setting effective.
SIGINT is used by the debugger.
Are you sure you want to change it? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]

3. No, I just use "   // --- 5) Install Strategy ---
   ns3::ndn::StrategyChoiceHelper::InstallAll(
     "/", "/localhost/nfd/strategy/best-route");" in the main function.
