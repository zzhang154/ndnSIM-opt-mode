## 2. Main Components

1.  **AggregatorApp (`agg-mini/aggregator/`)**
    *   Receives upstream Interests (e.g., from `RootApp`).
    *   Fans out corresponding Interests to multiple downstream children (`LeafApp`s).
    *   Uses `AggBufferManager` to track responses for each sequence number.
    *   Aggregates results (sums) received from children.
    *   Replies upstream with the aggregated result upon completion or timeout.

2.  **RootApp (`agg-mini/root/`)**
    *   Initiates the process by sending sequential Interests (e.g., `/app/agg/seq=1`, `/app/agg/seq=2`, ...).
    *   Inherits from `ndn::Consumer`.
    *   Configurable interval and maximum sequence number.

3.  **LeafApp (`agg-mini/leaf/`)**
    *   Simple producer application.
    *   Inherits from `ndn::Producer`.
    *   Listens for Interests on its configured prefix (e.g., `/app/leaf1/seq=N`).
    *   Replies with Data packets containing a payload (presumably a value based on the sequence number or node ID, though the exact payload generation isn't shown in `LeafApp.cpp` itself, it relies on the base `Producer` logic).

4.  **Aggregation Buffer (`agg-mini/buffer/`)**
    *   **`AggBuffer`**: Stores the state for a single aggregation sequence number, including the expected count, received count, partial sum, parent Interest name, and timeout event ID.
    *   **`AggBufferManager`**: Manages multiple `AggBuffer` instances, keyed by sequence number. Handles buffer creation, retrieval, removal, and scheduling/canceling straggler timeouts.

5.  **Utilities (`agg-mini/common/`)**
    *   `CommonUtils.hpp` (referenced but not provided): Likely contains helper functions, possibly for encoding/decoding data payloads or setting packet fields.

6.  **Example Scenario (`examples/agg-mini/`)**
    *   `agg-mini-simulation.cpp`:
        *   Reads physical topology (`agg-mini-topo.txt`) and logical tree structure (`tree.txt`).
        *   Identifies node roles (Root, Aggregator, Leaf) based on the tree structure.
        *   Installs the NDN stack and sets up FIB routes according to the tree.
        *   Installs `RootApp`, `AggregatorApp`, and `LeafApp` on the appropriate nodes with configured prefixes and parameters.
        *   Uses `ndn::GlobalRoutingHelper` to establish reachability.
        *   Runs the ns-3 simulation for a fixed duration.

## 3. Integration into ndnSIM

*   Files are placed under `src/ndnSIM/apps/agg-mini/` and `src/ndnSIM/examples/agg-mini/`, suggesting integration with the ndnSIM source tree.
*   Assumes `wscript` files (not provided) exist to compile these components and register the `agg-mini-simulation` example with `waf`.
*   Applications inherit from ndnSIM base classes (`App`, `Consumer`, `Producer`).
*   Utilizes core ndnSIM/ns-3 features: `AppHelper`, `FibHelper`, `AnnotatedTopologyReader`, `Simulator`, `LogComponent`, `TypeId`, Attributes, `Names`, `Node`, `Ptr`, `Callback`, `EventId`, `Time`.
*   Interacts with ndn-cxx objects (`ndn::Name`, `ndn::Interest`, `ndn::Data`, `ndn::Block`).
*   The simulation is likely run via `./waf --run agg-mini-simulation` (or similar, depending on the exact example name in `wscript`).
